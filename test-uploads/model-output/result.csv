I refer to your letter of 16th October to my client ABC in relation to his deferred pension benefits in the Test Pension Scheme . ABC had requested a CETV back in August but did not received anything until late October after he had chased up several times . The CETV was resent with your letter but still retained the original Guarantee date of 21st November   ABC called to query this and was advised that he could have a 10 day extension ie 1st December .  ABC wishes to proceed with the transfer and I now attach the signed Discharge form which will hopefully secure the transfer value   we will forward all the supporting documentation as soon as possible . I would mention that unfortunately ABC suffered a heart attack in April and is back in hospital today for another angiogram so we hope that there are no issues which will cause any unnecessary stress . I appreciate your assistance .  Regards , Test IFA    '",Transfers
