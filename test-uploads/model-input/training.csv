You are therefore receiving this before the st January deadline for the CETV so we hope all is satisfactory for you to proceed. We would be obliged if you reply as quickly as possible please, acknowledging this email and enclosures and confirming that you have all you need to process the transfer. We look forward to hearing further from you. Many thanks Kind regards ABC XYZ ABC XYZ TST Hi there Following the attached letter you have sent to the client only just received today by the way as using the postal system with Covid delays around the world is not ideal we are planning to email you all the transfer documentation you require by the deadline of st January, which is the CETV guarantee date, as the transfer to an overseas Test Pension Scheme is to proceed. We are just awaiting on some final documents to come through to us before we email this all through to you. You have already advised us that you will accept emailed transfer documentation, so once you receive this, you will hopefully have everything you need to process the transfer. The letter you therefore sent to the client is somewhat confusing, as the CETV deadline is st January however, we also note in the letter that we are still able to provide you with the paperwork and the transfer can be made before st January . We will forward the paperwork to you soon however, if you have any questions, please contact us. Thank you Kind regards Charlene Fw Internet Fax Job Hi I received this letter today from Fin Corp Ltd.

Kind Regards TEST FUND Member Address Change ZZ Z Good Morning Mr ABC ZZ Z moved address in September , although this has not been updated with TEST. Please can you change your records to reflect the following address Many thanks in advance for your help. Kind Regards TEST FUND '","b'\r\n RE: Member Address Change ZZ123123Z\r\n\r\nHi ABC,\r\n\r\nI can confirm that this has now been corrected.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nTEST PENSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n RE: Member Address Change ZZ123123Z\r\n\r\nGood Morning\r\n\r\nPlease could I escalate this as only half of this address change has been completed- on Mr ABC\xe2\x80\x99S TEST account it is showing half his old address and half his new address. This could be a technical error or something perhaps, although Mr ABC is needing the correct information to be displayed.\r\n\r\nThis was initially requested manually by myself on this email trail on 27th October as I believe he may have missed the September cut off for the address feed, as he moved in September.\r\n\r\nSo that I am able to resolve his query from our end, please can this be changed as soon as possible?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\n\r\nTEST FUND\r\n\r\n\r\n FW: Member Address Change ZZ123123Z\r\n\r\nGood Morning\r\n\r\nFurther to the below request, the member has contacted us today to inform only half of his address has been changed, and this is therefore still incorrect. Please can this be looked into, and the address changed exactly as the initial request?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nTEST FUND\r\n\r\n\r\n Member Address Change ZZ123123Z\r\n\r\nGood Morning\r\n\r\nMr ABC (ZZ123123Z) moved address in September 2019, although this has not been updated with TEST. Please can you change your records to reflect the following address:\r\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nTEST FUND\r\n\r\n\r\n'",MDU
