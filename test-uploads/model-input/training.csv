Last correspondence from you was a letter dated 7 September saying you were asking CGI for a response and would get back to me. Your letters always state that I can contact you by phone, but this is not the case as the options I am given by the automated service blocks me from getting through.     I appreciate that the current circumstances have had an effect and also know that my question is a minor one but it is very frustrating that it is taking more than 3 months to get an answer from you.

Today I received a payment of  7,243.42, so am wondering whether this is a net amount after tax has been taken out      I am very happy to receive the arrears and thank you but would appreciate clarification on the amount.

TST12345678              To whom it may concern     I recently retired from Test Pensions cables.     I am now With Fin Corp financial who is now managing my pensions. My financial advisor s are Test IFA based in London. My financial advisor made a request to transfer funds to my pension pot 5 weeks ago which was authorised by me and today I received a letter from you guys saying basically warning me off scams etc etc. The fact that it has taken you 5 weeks to send this letter is beyond belief.      I am retired now and need those funds transferring as requested. Why you have sent this letter I do not know as you obviously know I have left Test Pensions as you have taken my log in privileges away so I cannot even see what is happening to my pension. On top off that I have rang you several times and been waiting for nearly an hour but get no answer.      The letter said it could take up to 6 months to transfer the funds, that is not acceptable as I need those funds in my pot earning me interest etc etc.     Can you please have a look and see what you can do to speed things up.

Should I wish to take my benefits earlier than normal retirement age NRA , the reduction I could expect With respect to , my understanding is that the rule of thumb calculation is to multiply the annual pension at retirement AP by . In the attached excel sheet I have attempted to project AP and Lifetime Allowance amounts using a number of assumptions. I have applied a range of RPI assumptions to items B C and the fixed p.a. to items A E over years. Item D Transferred in Pension, p.a. as at will be at least the fixed pension guarantee of p.a. at age according to my attached pdf Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits, so I have assumed this amount as any higher amount would need average compound growth of over p.a. which seems unlikely .

I would be grateful if you could confirm that my understanding and expectations are correct using the stated assumptions for RPI. With respect to item , I would be grateful for an understanding of how much my annual pension could be if benefits were taken early, for example now, and how I could estimate what this value could be as each year passes between now and NRA. In terms of reduction, would item D above include a reduced proportion of the fixed pension guarantee of p.a. which then ought to be higher than the p.a. as at I look forward to hearing from you again in due course.

Kind regards, ABC XYZ Test Road, Test Street, AA Tel Mob '","b'       Reference TST12345678  ABC XYZ   Test Pension Scheme, Membership Number ZZ123123Z,  2 further important areas of understanding  Importance  High     Dear Sirs,  ABC XYZ  National Insurance Number   ZZ123123Z  Smiths Industries Pension Scheme  Reference   TST12345678  Thank you for your letter dated 30 10 2020 confirming correction of my statement as at 01 01 1400 and explanation as to why my Fin Corp account is not yet up to date.  I would like to take the opportunity to enquire about two further important areas of understanding please    1. The possible size of Lifetime Allowance amount to be expected from the SIPS at retirement  2. Should I wish to take my benefits earlier than normal retirement age  NRA  , the reduction I could expect  With respect to  1 , my understanding is that the rule of thumb calculation is to multiply the annual pension at retirement  AP   by 20. In the attached excel sheet I have attempted to project AP and Lifetime Allowance amounts using a number of assumptions. I have applied a range of RPI assumptions to items B   C and the fixed 5  p.a. to items A   E over 10 years. Item D Transferred in Pension,  100 p.a. as at 01 01 1400  will be at least  the fixed pension guarantee of  500 p.a.  at age 65 according to my attached pdf Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits, so I have assumed this amount as any higher amount would need average compound growth of over 10  p.a. which seems unlikely .  The sum of all of these using RPI assumptions of 1 , 2.5  and 4  computes AP values of c 10k, c 20k and c 50k respectively   and applying the rule of thumb x10 calculation computes Lifetime Allowance amounts of c 300k, c 500k and c 600k respectively at NRA. I would be grateful if you could confirm that my understanding and expectations are correct using the stated assumptions for RPI.  With respect to item  2 , I would be grateful for an understanding of how much my annual pension could be if benefits were taken early, for example now, and how I could estimate what this value could be as each year passes between now and NRA. In terms of reduction, would item D above include a reduced proportion of  the fixed pension guarantee of  1000 p.a.  which then ought to be higher than the  300  p.a. as at 01 01 1400   I look forward to hearing from you again in due course.  Many thanks.

However, the figure quoted appears unexplainably low in relation to last year s valuation which I would like to urgently query please   the format of the letter also lacks the requested detailed format I have received each year and been accustomed to so it is not possible to follow how this has been calculated, but it does not seem correct according to the scheme rules. I am also concerned should Fin Corp Ltd. not have received my full pension details from Fin Corp 2 Ltd. and this perhaps explains the sudden inconsistent valuation as well as why my Fin Corp account lacks the correct up to date pension details.  In order to ensure your records are complete and assist with my query, I am attaching in addition the following with comments    1. My official Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits received 01 01 1400 with key notes including how my Augmented Preserved Pension will increase over time according to the rules  2. An excel sheet showing each year s detailed valuation starting 01 01 1400   500  until 01 01 1400   1000   attached    I have a detailed Annual Valuation Letter for each of these years from initially Fin Corp 1, then Fin Corp 2, and then Fin Corp 3. The key point is that the  Scheme GMP and  Transferred in GMP  are guaranteed to be increased by 10  p.a., and the rest is guaranteed to increase by the lower of 10  or RPI p.a. with an additional guarantee minimum fixed pension of  700  p.a. for the  Transferred in Pension . The sheet shows that a value of  1000 on 01 01 1400 cannot be mathematically correct   even if RPI for 2019 20 had been 0 , the resulting value on 01 01 1400 would have been higher than  1000, and with an assumed estimated RPI of 3  it would be  1500. The sheet also shows a projection at retirement age assuming average RPI of 2.8  p.a. to emphasize how import the correct annual increases are combining with the  Transferred in Pension  guarantee for the overall pension amount.  I would therefore be grateful for the following please      A review of the above valuation and then issuance of the detailed Annual Valuation Letter in the form prepared by Fin Corp Ltd. as attached which tabulates each component as at 01 01 1400 with the confirmatory narrative which aligns with my Preserved Retirement Benefits  details   hopefully this results in an updated correct valuation    Update of my Fin Corp account for my pension details and overall confirmation that my pension details are held safely by Fin Corp and are up to date  Finally, I intend to continue to request this Annual Valuation Letter and would ask if it could be possible please to receive this automatically each year for 1 May   if not possible, I will continue requesting each year.

Last correspondence from you was a letter dated 7 September saying you were asking CGI for a response and would get back to me. Your letters always state that I can contact you by phone, but this is not the case as the options I am given by the automated service blocks me from getting through.     I appreciate that the current circumstances have had an effect and also know that my question is a minor one but it is very frustrating that it is taking more than 3 months to get an answer from you.

Today I received a payment of  7,243.42, so am wondering whether this is a net amount after tax has been taken out      I am very happy to receive the arrears and thank you but would appreciate clarification on the amount.

This was initially requested manually by myself on this email trail on 27th October as I believe he may have missed the September cut off for the address feed, as he moved in September.    So that I am able to resolve his query from our end, please can this be changed as soon as possible     Many thanks in advance    TEST FUND       FW  Member Address Change ZZ123123Z    Good Morning    Further to the below request, the member has contacted us today to inform only half of his address has been changed, and this is therefore still incorrect. Please can this be looked into, and the address changed exactly as the initial request     Many thanks in advance for your help.    Kind Regards    TEST FUND       Member Address Change ZZ123123Z    Good Morning    Mr ABC  ZZ123123Z  moved address in September 2019, although this has not been updated with TEST. Please can you change your records to reflect the following address   Many thanks in advance for your help.    Kind Regards    TEST FUND      '",MDU
