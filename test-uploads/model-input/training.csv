In the attached excel sheet I have attempted to project AP and Lifetime Allowance amounts using a number of assumptions. I have applied a range of RPI assumptions to items B & C and the fixed 5% p.a. to items A & E over 10 years. Item D(Transferred-in Pension, \xc2\xa3100 p.a. as at 01/01/1400) will be at least \xe2\x80\x9cthe fixed pension guarantee of \xc2\xa3500 p.a.\xe2\x80\x9d at age 65 according to my attached pdf Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits, so I have assumed this amount(as any higher amount would need average compound growth of over 10% p.a. which seems unlikely). The sum of all of these using RPI assumptions of 1%, 2.5% and 4% computes AP values of c\xc2\xa310k, c\xc2\xa320k and c\xc2\xa350k respectively \xe2\x80\x93 and applying the rule of thumb x10 calculation computes Lifetime Allowance amounts of c\xc2\xa3300k, c\xc2\xa3500k and c\xc2\xa3600k respectively at NRA. I would be grateful if you could confirm that my understanding and expectations are correct using the stated assumptions for RPI. With respect to item (2), I would be grateful for an understanding of how much my annual pension could be if benefits were taken early, for example now, and how I could estimate what this value could be as each year passes between now and NRA. In terms of reduction, would item D above include a reduced proportion of \xe2\x80\x9cthe fixed pension guarantee of \xc2\xa31000 p.a.\xe2\x80\x9d which then ought to be higher than the \xc2\xa3300 p.a. as at 01/01/1400? I look forward to hearing from you again in due course. Many thanks. Kind regards, ABC XYZ 10 Test Road, Test Street, AA12 123 Tel: +91 012345678 Mob: +91 012345678 Reference TST12345678 -ABC XYZ - Test Pension Scheme, Membership Number ZZ123123Z, 2 further important areas of understanding Dear Sirs, ABC XYZ National Insurance Number:- ZZ123123Z Test Pension Scheme Reference:- TST12345678 Since my email below, the attached Annual Valuation Letter arrived in the post on 17/10/2020. However, the figure quoted appears unexplainably low in relation to last year\xe2\x80\x99s valuation which I would like to urgently query please \xe2\x80\x93 the format of the letter also lacks the requested detailed format I have received each year and been accustomed to so it is not possible to follow how this has been calculated, but it does not seem correct according to the scheme rules. I am also concerned should Fin Corp Ltd. not have received my full pension details from Fin Corp 2 Ltd. and this perhaps explains the sudden inconsistent valuation as well as why my Fin Corp account lacks the correct up to date pension details. In order to ensure your records are complete and assist with my query, I am attaching in addition the following with comments:- 1.\tMy official Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits received 01/01/1400 with key notes including how my Augmented Preserved Pension will increase over time according to the rules 2.\tAn excel sheet showing each year\xe2\x80\x99s detailed valuation starting 01/01/1400 (\xc2\xa3500) until 01/01/1400 (\xc2\xa31000 \xe2\x80\x93 attached) \xe2\x80\x93 I have a detailed Annual Valuation Letter for each of these years from initially Fin Corp 1, then Fin Corp 2, and then Fin Corp 3. The key point is that the \xe2\x80\x9cScheme GMP and \xe2\x80\x9cTransferred in GMP\xe2\x80\x9d are guaranteed to be increased by 10% p.a., and the rest is guaranteed to increase by the lower of 10% or RPI p.a. with an additional guarantee minimum fixed pension of \xc2\xa3700 p.a. for the \xe2\x80\x9cTransferred in Pension\xe2\x80\x9d. The sheet shows that a value of \xc2\xa31000 on 01/01/1400 cannot be mathematically correct \xe2\x80\x93 even if RPI for 2019/20 had been 0%, the resulting value on 01/01/1400 would have been higher than \xc2\xa31000, and with an assumed estimated RPI of 3% it would be \xc2\xa31500. The sheet also shows a projection at retirement age assuming average RPI of 2.8% p.a. to emphasize how import the correct annual increases are combining with the \xe2\x80\x9cTransferred in Pension\xe2\x80\x9d guarantee for the overall pension amount. I would therefore be grateful for the following please:- *\tA review of the above valuation and then issuance of the detailed Annual Valuation Letter in the form prepared by Fin Corp Ltd. as attached which tabulates each component as at 01/01/1400 with the confirmatory narrative which aligns with my Preserved Retirement Benefits\xe2\x80\x99 details \xe2\x80\x93 hopefully this results in an updated correct valuation *\tUpdate of my Fin Corp account for my pension details and overall confirmation that my pension details are held safely by Fin Corp and are up to date Finally, I intend to continue to request this Annual Valuation Letter and would ask if it could be possible please to receive this automatically each year for 1 May \xe2\x80\x93 if not possible, I will continue requesting each year. I look forward to hearing from you again in due course. Many thanks.

I hope that you can deal with this request urgently as time is passing and we must have confirmation on the extension to 30 January before taking further action.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards  ABC XYZ   Extending decision time    : Test Pension Scheme Dear Ms ABC XYZ  Thank you for the amended pension transfer pack received on 1 Jan.  The pack refers to the transfer value of my pension as at 10 Jan. It also indicates that the transfer value expires on the 10 December. Given that the transfer pack did not get to me until 30 Jan following delays. That leaves just about 6 weeks to take advice from my financial adviser; which he tells me will include further information gathering from Fin Corp, reflect, make a decision, complete and return the necessary documents to Fin Corp. I feel that the period is too short and my financial adviser (who is very experienced in dealing with defined benefits transfers) also feels that it would be too short to make this deadline even In a best case scenario.   When considering this request please bear in mind the difficulties that companies like Fin Corp have in providing a normal service due to covid restrictions. I am sure you will also consider that financial advice is not as accessible during this current lockdown (my adviser confirms that his firm is unable to make face to face meetings which in my circumstances is not ideal). The length of time involved in producing braille copies of print documents should also be considered as there is always an interval of 7 to 10 days between the date on the print letter and the date THAT I RECEIVE IT IN BRAILLE.   Can I suggest, and respectfully request given the circumstances,  that the three month guaranteed transfer value window should start from 30 October when I received the amended transfer pack   I look forward to hearing from you urgently on this matter.
